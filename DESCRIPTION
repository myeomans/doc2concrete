Title: Measuring Concreteness in Natural Language
Version: 0.4.5
Author: Mike Yeomans
Maintainer: Mike Yeomans <mk.yeomans@gmail.com>
Description: Models for detecting concreteness in natural language. This package is built in support of Yeomans (2020) <doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/DYZN6>, which reviews linguistic models of concreteness in several domains. Here, we provide an implementation of the best-performing domain-general model (from Brysbaert et al., (2014)<doi:10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5>) as well as two pre-trained models for the feedback and plan-making domains.
